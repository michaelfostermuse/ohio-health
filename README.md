# Ohio Health iOS Speech recognition pilot.

This repository is an example implementation of iOS client use of the Speech framework. It is written in Swift 5.x using the SwiftUI canvas.
The ohio-health sample app should be run on an iOS physical device as the Speech framework is not available on the simulator.
